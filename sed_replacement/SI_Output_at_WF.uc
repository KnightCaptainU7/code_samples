They fled away with great haste.  Later a merchant traveling to the keep from Shasavrah reported that he had seen the thieves in a small town west of the keep, but the orb was stolen from them, along with much of their supplies, in the night. The orb appeared again in the hands of authorities in Thiriastith, who siezed it from a suspected stolen goods fence.  Not knowing its import, the authorities auctioned it as a bauble to a wizard who knew what the orb was.  This wizard, who was known only as the Asp, aspired to steal the silver seed.  He came to Serpent's Fang as an adventure seeker and was told that the other orbs were stolen or lost.  He discerned their whereabouts from this information, but that which he was told was apparently not true, for he set out immediately for Aram-Dol's lair.  Foolishly, he brought the one orb he possessed with him into those foul tunnels of Aram-Dol's lair.  The dead that walk those caverns and tunnels soon forced the Asp to join them in their ever-living death.
